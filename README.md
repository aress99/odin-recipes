# odin-recipes
Recipe project
The odin-recipes project is to show what knowledge I have gained from the HTML Foundations Course. The main goal of the project is to build a website which has 3 recipes free of choice.
I will be using text elements, as well as the anchor element to link to other HTML documents and img element to link images to my webpages.
